# ttx Overview

A modern terminal multiplexer.

## Features

The main goal of ttx to provide a good user experience when mixing local and remote terminal sessions, and support new
terminal features in a timely manner (think kitty graphics/keyboard protocol). Instead of being a source of
compatibility issues, I want ttx to _just work_ when users try out new terminal features. And managing remote sessions should
be simple and painless. Instead of having 1 terminal window and 1 tmux session per host, or nesting tmux sessions inside
each other, ttx aims to unify remote hosts into a single terminal environment. I think this can be a huge improvement for
developers who regularly need to develop on remote machines.

This project is currently in very early development, so there is a lot of the features listed here haven't
yet been implemented. This list focuses only on higher level features, leaving out a lot of the lower level
details.

- [x] Platform support
  - [x] Linux
  - [x] MacOS
  - [ ] Windows (not a priority)
- [x] Basic multiplexing functionality
  - [x] Layout tree with horizontal and vertical splits
  - [x] Multiple tabs (tmux windows)
  - [x] Multiple sessions
  - [x] Popup windows
  - [x] Support session/window/pane switcher via Fzf popup
- [ ] Graphics

        or dropping the SSH connection.
- [-] Session Persistence Across Reboots
  - [x] Manual save/restore (tmux-resurrect) (partial support (layout+cwd only, not processes or scrollback))

- [ ] Remote Machines
  - [ ] Support ephemeral connections via ssh
  - [ ] Support persistent connections via ssh
    - [ ] Will run a daemon on the remote which will synchronize locally.
  - [ ] Connection management UX
  - [ ] Support creating sessions/windows/panes using remote connections
