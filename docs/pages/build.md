# Building

This package can be built either directly through [CMake](https://cmake.org/) or using [nix](https://nixos.org/).

## Building with CMake

### Prerequisites

- Install CMake version 3.21 or later.
- Install either GCC 14+ or Clang 19+.

### Dependencies

- The [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) program. This is used at runtime for various menus. To be clear, this
  dependency is only needed for the `ttx` application and not the terminal emulation library itself.
- The [dius](https://github.com/coletrammer/dius) library.
- The [di](https://github.com/coletrammer/di) library (dependency of dius).

The dius library will be found using CMake `find_package` unless the source is available
at the path specified by `ttx_dius_DIRECTORY`. By default, that CMake variable is set
`./dius`. When using nix, the library's flake is included automatically.

The recommended setup for building ttx from source involves the following shell commands.

```sh
# Clone all repositories
git clone https://github.com/coletrammer/di
git clone https://github.com/coletrammer/dius
git clone https://github.com/coletrammer/ttx

# Setup dependencies
ln -s "$(realpath ./di)" ./dius/di
ln -s "$(realpath ./dius)" ./ttx/dius
```

### Manual Build Commands

To manually build ttx and its library, use the following commands.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

### Install Commands

```sh
cmake --install build
```

### Consuming the ttx Library via CMake

This project exports a CMake package to be used with the
[`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html)
command of CMake:

- Package name: `ttx`
- Target name: `ttx::ttx`

In general, you can either include `find_package(ttx REQUIRED)` somewhere in your CMake build or call
`add_subdirectory` on the ttx source code. When using `find_package`, it probably makes sense to use
fetch content to download the library during the build. When using `add_subdirectory`, this project
can be included as a git submodule. Because CMake is CMake, there's several other ways to make
things work, and this library tries to be as flexible as possible so that both of the above methods
will succeed.

Afterwards, use the library via `target_link_libraries(target PRIVATE ttx::ttx)`.

### Note to packagers

Any `ttx` package should depend on `fzf` as `ttx` requires the `fzf` program to be
in the user's PATH on application startup.

The `CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR` is set to a path other than just `include` if
the project is configured as a top level project to avoid indirectly including
other libraries when installed to a common prefix. Please review the
[install-rules.cmake](cmake/install-rules.cmake) file for the full set of
install rules.

## Building with nix

### Prerequisites

- Install [nix](https://nixos.org/download/).
- Enable the following [experimental features](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/development/experimental-features):
  - nix-command
  - flakes

### Consuming via Flake

This section assumes you are interested in the ttx library. See [./install.md] for instructions on
installing the ttx application using nix.

To consume the library in your flake, add ttx as an input:

```nix
ttx = {
  url = "github.com/coletrammer/ttx";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
};
```

Then include `inputs.ttx.packages.${system}.ttx-lib` in the `buildInputs` of your derivation. Assuming your
project is using CMake, `find_package(ttx)` will succeed automatically.

This flake provides takes the di and dius libraries as a flake input, so it can be overridden easily. The
`fzf` dependency is taken from nixpkgs (which is also easy to override), and the `ttx` binary is wrapped
by nix to ensure `fzf` will be in the `PATH` variable when running `ttx`.

### Manual Build Commands

Alternatively, use the `nix` command to build the library manually.

```sh
nix build .#ttx-lib
```

This outputs the result to `./result`.
